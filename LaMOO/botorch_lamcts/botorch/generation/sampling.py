Sampling-based generation strategies.

A SamplingStrategy returns samples from the input points (i.e. Tensors in feature
space), rather than the value for a set of tensors, as acquisition functions do.
The q-batch dimension has similar semantics as for acquisition functions in that the
points across the q-batch are considered jointly for sampling (where as for
q-acquisition functions we evaluate the joint value of the q-batch).
