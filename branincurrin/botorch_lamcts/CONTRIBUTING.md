# Contributing to BoTorch

We want to make contributing to BoTorch is as easy and transparent as possible.


## Development installation

To get the development installation with all the necessary dependencies for
linting, testing, and building the documentation, run the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/botorch.git
cd botorch
pip install -e .[dev]
```


## Our Development Process

#### Code Style

BoTorch uses the [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) code formatter to
enforce a common code style across the code base. black is installed easily via
pip using `pip install black`, and run locally by calling
```bash
black .
```
from the repository root. No additional configuration should be needed (see the
[black documentation](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation_and_usage.html#usage)
for advanced usage).

We feel strongly that having a consistent code style is extremely important, so
Travis will fail on your PR if it does not adhere to the black formatting style.


#### Type Hints

BoTorch is fully typed using python 3.7+
[type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/).
We expect any contributions to also use proper type annotations. While we
currently do not enforce full consistency of these in our continuous integration
test, you should strive to type check your code locally. For this we recommend
using [pyre](https://pyre-check.org/).


#### Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, you can either use `pytest` (if installed):
```bash
pytest -ra
```
or python's `unittest`:
```bash
python -m unittest
```

To get coverage reports we recommend using the `pytest-cov` plugin:
```bash
pytest -ra --cov=. --cov-report term-missing
```


#### Documentation

BoTorch's website is also open source, and is part of this very repository (the
code can be found in the [website](/website/) folder).
It is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and consists of three
main elements:

1. The documentation in Docusaurus itself (if you know Markdown, you can
   already contribute!). This lives in the [docs](/docs/).
2. The API reference, auto-generated from the docstrings using
   [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org), and embedded into the Docusaurus website.
   The sphinx .rst source files for this live in [sphinx/source](/sphinx/source/).
3. The Jupyter notebook tutorials, parsed by `nbconvert`, and embedded into the
   Docusaurus website. These live in [tutorials](/tutorials/).

To build the documentation you will need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 8.x
and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) >= 1.5.

The following command will both build the docs and serve the site locally:
```bash
./scripts/build_docs.sh
```

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you have added code that should be tested, add unit tests.
   In other words, add unit tests.
3. If you have changed APIs, update the documentation. Make sure the
   documentation builds.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code passes both `black` and `flake8` formatting checks.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").


## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")

In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need
to do this once to work on any of Facebook's open source projects. You can
complete your CLA here: <https://code.facebook.com/cla>


## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.
