        Performs a `k`-step lookahead by means of repeated fantasizing.

        Allows to specify the stage value functions by passing the respective class
        objects via the `valfunc_cls` list. Optionally, `valfunc_argfacs` takes a list
        of callables that generate additional kwargs for these constructors. By default,
        `valfunc_cls` will be chosen as `[None, ..., None, PosteriorMean]`, which
        corresponds to the (parallel) multi-step KnowledgeGradient. If, in addition,
        `k=1` and `q_1 = 1`, this reduces to the classic Knowledge Gradient.

        WARNING: The complexity of evaluating this function is exponential in the number
        of lookahead steps!

        Args:
            model: A fitted model.
            batch_sizes: A list `[q_1, ..., q_k]` containing the batch sizes for the
                `k` look-ahead steps.
            num_fantasies: A list `[f_1, ..., f_k]` containing the number of fantasy
                points to use for the `k` look-ahead steps.
            samplers: A list of MCSampler objects to be used for sampling fantasies in
                each stage.
            valfunc_cls: A list of `k + 1` acquisition function classes to be used as
                the (stage + terminal) value functions. Each element (except for the
                last one) can be `None`, in which case a zero stage value is assumed for
                the respective stage. If `None`, this defaults to
                `[None, ..., None, PosteriorMean]`
            valfunc_argfacs: A list of `k + 1` "argument factories", i.e. callables that
                map a `Model` and input tensor `X` to a dictionary of kwargs for the
                respective stage value function constructor (e.g. `best_f` for
                `ExpectedImprovement`). If None, only the standard (`model`, `sampler`
                and `objective`) kwargs will be used.
            objective: The objective under which the output is evaluated. If `None`, use
                the model output (requires a single-output model). If a
                `ScalarizedObjective` and `value_function_cls` is a subclass of
                `AnalyticAcquisitonFunction`, then the analytic posterior mean is used.
                Otherwise the objective is MC-evaluated (using `inner_sampler`).
            inner_mc_samples: A list `[n_0, ..., n_k]` containing the number of MC
                samples to be used for evaluating the stage value function. Ignored if
                the objective is `None` or a `ScalarizedObjective`.
            X_pending: A `m x d`-dim Tensor of `m` design points that have points that
                have been submitted for function evaluation but have not yet been
                evaluated. Concatenated into `X` upon forward call. Copied and set to
                have no gradient.

                will be applied on fantasy batch dimensions as well, meaning that base
