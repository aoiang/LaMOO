    Create a callable mapping a Tensor of size `b x q x m` to a Tensor of size
    `b x q`, where `m` is the number of outputs of the model using scalarization
    via the objective weights. This callable supports broadcasting (e.g. for
    calling on a tensor of shape `mc_samples x b x q x m`). For `m = 1`, the
    objective weight is used to determine the optimization direction.

    Args:
        weights: a 1-dimensional Tensor containing a weight for each task.
            If not provided, the identity mapping is used.

    Returns:
        Transform function using the objective weights.
